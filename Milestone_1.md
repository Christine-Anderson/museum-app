This will include information on Articles stored in the museum, such as the date they were acquired, and the name and condition of the item. These articles will be sorted into collections and displayed in exhibits. The exhibits will have names, and the dates which they are running. It will also store contracts pertaining to articles that have been loaned to the museum by an owner. As well, the application will store information about visitors (name and email) who can buy tickets to view the exhibit and attend activities. </p>
